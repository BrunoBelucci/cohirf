# Recursive Clustering

This is a draft repo that was used for the development of CoHiRF: A Scalable and Interpretable Clustering Framework for
High-Dimensional Data (https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.00380). With time, most of features implemented here will be 
moved to the CoHiRF repo (https://github.com/BrunoBelucci/cohirf).
